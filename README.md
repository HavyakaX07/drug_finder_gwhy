NOT ABLE TO FIND THE MEDICINE ? YOUR AT THE RIGHT PLACE. FIND DRUG HERE!

Most of the people struggle to find right drug or medicine for the condition or disease the person is suffering from. Drug Digger app will help the user to find the drug for specific condition.

This web internally uses WebMd site https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/conditions/index  .

Whatever the drugs available in the site those are available in the Drug Finder Web app.

TECH INFO:

Server part of the web-app is done using flask and python. Postgres is being used as Data-Container. Front-end Development completely developed by Jinja tool, HTML, CSS and JS. Selenium automation is being used along with Chrome Web-Driver to Scrap the Images from the website. Finally Thanks to Heroku for providing the deployment platform. (Its free until 21st of Nov 2022. !Hurry deploy your first application!)


Impediments:

There may little-bit of delay in showing the response. That will happen because of

web-scrapping and Chrome-Web driver. I appreciate your patience.

Future-Scope:

Next Idea will be analyzing the Data gathered from the site and feed it to the AI-ML model and predicting the which drug is more being used in the particular area and what is the most frequently encountered disease. Since I am not very good at Front-end, there is opportunity to improve the UI.

Conclusion:

Drug finder web-app will assist the user to find the medicine list from condition or disease name that the person is suffering from. Hope this will help the user. Take doctors consultation this is not the final recommendation.
